    <h2>How to Prepare Japanese Chicken Curry</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
        <li>Discard the extra fat from the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Peel and cut the carrot in rolling wedges (Rangiri) and cut the onions in wedges.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
        </li>
        <li>Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions until they become translucent and tender.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.
        </li>
        <li>Add the carrot and mix well to coat with oil.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and bring it to a boil. Chicken broth contains a different amount of salt. If you're careful with sodium intake or not sure if your chicken stock is too salty, you can use water only, or use half stock + half water. You can always add salt at the end of cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Once boiling, using a fine-mesh strainer, skim the scrum and fat from the surface of the broth.
        </li>
        <li>Peel the apple and grate it (use as much as you like to add sweetness). I've been using this grater and love it.
        </li>
        <li>Add the honey and salt and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. If you use the store-bought curry roux, put 1-2 blocks of roux in a ladle and slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks. Continue with the rest of the blocks.
        </li>
        <li>If you're using homemade curry roux, scoop a ladleful or two of cooking liquid from the curry broth and add it into the curry paste in a saucepan. Add more cooking liquid if necessary and mix well until it’s smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add the roux mixture back into the soup and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and ketchup (and any other condiments you're adding – see the blog post). Simmer uncovered on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the curry becomes thick.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the curry with Japanese rice on the side. If you like, garnish with soft-boiled egg and fukujinzuke.
        </li>
