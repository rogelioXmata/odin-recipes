<p>Hello! This is Rogelio's first project!</p>
<ul>
    <li> For this project, I got to build a simple website for 3 food recipes (my choice of foods for this project were all Japanese). During the project, I got to learn how to use my terminal to navigate, create/delete files/directories, and how to push code to Github. In addition, I learned how to quickly apply the HTML boilerplate as well as add images, headers, paragraph text, bold text, and italicized text to my HTML code through a text editor (I'm using visual studio code). Lastly, I learned how to create links between pages and how to creat unordered and ordered lists for my recipes. </li>  
    <li> I just went by the project totally forgetting about pushing my work to my repository on Github. I had to figure out how to push code to Github again after completing my project but this is a note that I need to get used to commiting my work early and getting the "feel" for pushing my codes to Github </li>
</ul>
